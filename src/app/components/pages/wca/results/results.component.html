          WRT is responsible for assigning and recognzining National, Contential and World records. 
          These records are manually assigned (due to complex rules, they cannot be auto-assigned). 
          There are instances where the same record may be broken at similar times at two different competitions. 
          This investigation identifies those and allows us to correct any misassigned records.

        <div>
          WCA's software is constantly evolving. As such we have new features that are not supported on older competitions due to the data not being present.
          Here are some of the fields that have been investigated and I have backfilled the data for:
          Competition Organizers, Banned Competitors, Delegate Promotion dates, Team and Leader Dates, Main Events, and Series Competitions.

        <div>
          There is some older data in WCA that required correcting. We continually investigate identifable mistakes in old results as well as look for ways to ensure that our results remain consistent world-wide.

        <div>
          There are some software issues that cause database entries to be deleted. This has caused foreign keys to point to an id that does not exist.
          For Example, this has happened a lot with users' accounts.
          I've worked to identify these and assign correct foreign key ids for these cases; as well, we've worked to identify errors in the software that cause these types of issues.
